    <h1>Metales Pesados</h1>
    <p>Los metales más densos tienen diversas aplicaciones, principalmente debido a su alta masa y propiedades mecánicas, que pueden ser aprovechadas en situaciones donde se requiera un material con gran peso y estabilidad. Algunos de los metales más densos incluyen el osmio, el iridio y el platino, entre otros. </p>

    <h2>Osmium</h2>
    <img src="images/osmio.png" alt="osmio">
    <p>Which is the most heavy metal on earth? Osmium is the heaviest metal found on earth. Osmium's weight is twice that of lead metal. This toxic and extremely volatile element is also the most dense metal in the periodic table, with a 22.59 g / cm³ density. It is a rare element that is extracted from platinum. And if you thought gold is valuable, then this hard, brittle metal with a bluish-white appearance is 30 times more valuable than gold because it is 1500 times rarer and has ten times more purity than gold. Osmium is used as an alloy in electrical contacts and fountain pens.</p>

    <h2>Iridium</h2>
    <img src="images/iridio.png" alt="Iridium">
    <p>Iridium is a brittle, hard metal and the second heaviest metal in the periodic table, with a 22.56 g/cm³ density. This silvery-white metal is related to platinum, remains rust-resistant and can sustain high temperatures. It is mostly extracted from South African, Russian, and Canadian nickel ores. The demand for Iridium mostly comes from the electronic, automotive, and chemical industries. It coats the electrodes in the Chlor- alkali process. </p>
    <br><br><br><br>

    <h2>Platinum</h2>
    <img src="images/platino.png" alt="platino">
    <p>With a density of 21.4 g/cm³, platinum is one of the heaviest metals on Earth. It is ductile, dense, malleable, unreactive, and one of the heaviest silver-white metals you can buy. Colombians first used the metal to produce artefacts. It is around 60% denser than gold and is used in emission control vehicles, precious jewellery, glass, medicines, and anti-cancer agents. Pure platinum is less expensive than pure gold. The precious metal mostly mined in South Africa is tough and resistant to wear hence preferred for hard disk drives.</p>

    <h2>Rhenium</h2>
    <img src="images/rhenium.png" alt="Rhenium">
    <p>Rhenium's density is 21.2 g / cm³, making it the fourth heaviest metal known. It is a tough metal that resists corrosion and has a high melting point, making it useful in applications for high temperatures.

Rhenium is also widely used as an electrical contact material due to its good electrical conductivity and resistance to wear.</p>
    <br><br><br><br>

    <h2>Plutonium</h2>
    <img src="images/plutonio.png" alt="plutonio">
    <p>Plutonium is an actinide metal that became famous after the explosion of the world's first atomic bomb in Nagasaki, Japan. It has a silvery grey appearance that tarnishes and dulls when exposed to oxygen.

It is a perfect power source for devices that need to function without maintenance for about an average human's lifespan.</p>
